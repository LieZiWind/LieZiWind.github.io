# subtitle: "Adding Natural User Interfaces to Software"

---

We develope an autonomous driving simulation system using LLMs in the decision-making stage and devised a method to translate a series of LLM decisions into simulation trajectories.

<!-- With Stan Melax. We ran a Hand-On lab for  Intel's Perceptual Computing SDK at the Intel Development Forum 2013 in San Francisco. The focus was on building novel user interactions and working with 3D sensor data. -->
