# subtitle: "Adding Natural User Interfaces to Software"

---

We introduce a novel approach that leverages LLMs to generate scalable and customizable planning-specific corner cases for autonomous driving systems. It is data-agnostic and training-free, incorporating intention-driven context by explicit natural language commands.

<!-- With Stan Melax. We ran a Hand-On lab for  Intel's Perceptual Computing SDK at the Intel Development Forum 2013 in San Francisco. The focus was on building novel user interactions and working with 3D sensor data. -->
